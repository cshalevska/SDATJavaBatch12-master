Types of variables:
There are three types of variables local, instance and static.
local variables:
The variables that are declared inside a method or block of code are called local
variables.
Pros:
Save Memory.
Cons:
limited access can not be accessed out side of methods or block of code where they are
declared.
Instance variables:
The variables which are declared inside a class but, outside a method or block of code
are called instance variables.
Pros:
instance variables are accessible in all the methods of that class
Cons:
they occupy the computers' memory for longer as compared to local variables
Static variables:
if instance variables have the static keyword with them, they are called static
variables.
Pros:
Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons:
Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory
than instance variables.
=============================================================
Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable,
method or a class etc. can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords
1) private 2) protected 3) public
Types of access are 4
1) private 2) default(applied when no keyword is used)   3) protected 4) public

private access(keyword is private):

when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes these
can only be accessed within that class.
default access(applied when we don't use any keyword):

when we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by java to
those variables methods or classes etc. which means These things can only be accessed
from the same package.

protected access(we use the protected class):
when protected access is applied class members(variables methods etc.) can be accessed
from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance.

public access(public keyword ):
public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that
project.
