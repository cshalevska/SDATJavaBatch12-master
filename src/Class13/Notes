Classes and Objects:
Classes are blueprints,ideas, designs or templates from which we create the
programming objects.
Programming objects:
Programming objects are similar to real life objects. They have attributes and
behaviours. Attributes represent the state of objects and behaviours repent the
integration of those objects.

Class Student{
String name;
String id;
int age;
char gender;
double gpa;
void study(){
System.out.println(name+" is studying")
}
public static void main(String []args){
Student tarikObj=new Student();
tarikObj.name="tarik";
tarikObj.study();

}
}
