Abstract classes in Java:
- they are classes with abstract keyword
-we use the abstract class to achieve abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality of the end user

-classes get tightly coupled
- class Dof{
//concrete class
}
public abstract class Phone{
Sting make;
String model;
