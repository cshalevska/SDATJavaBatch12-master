Maps in java:

Masp is an interface that allows us to store the data in the key value pairs.

Benefits:
1) we can strore two values inside the maps
2) Searching is very efficient in maps

Type of maps:
1. HashMap
2. LinkedHashMap
3. TreeMap

HashMap:
1. Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
2.insertion and retrival is fastest( upside)

LinkedHashMap:
1.insertion order is maintained ( upside)
2.insertion speed is same as Hashmap but retrival speed is slowest in all the maps

TreeMap:
1.Data is stored in natural order by default
2. insertion speed is slowest but retrieval spredd is better that LinkHashMap
but slower than the HaspMAp

Rules:
We can not convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert

Map<String,String> students=new Map<>();
students.put("Yaz123,"Yazgul");
Set<String> set=new HashSet(students);
