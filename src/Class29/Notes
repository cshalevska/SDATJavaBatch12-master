Set in java:

Set is an interface in collections frameworks which is implimented by many classes for example:
- Hashset,LinkedHashSet and ThreeHashSet

Properties of :
All the Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:
HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
- it is the fastes in all sets
-most widely used set
LinkedHashSet:
- maintains the insertion order
-slower that HashSet but faster that ThreSet specially in insertions
TreeSet:
- sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order
- it is slowest when it comes to store the data

When to use which type of Set:
- If we don't care abpout insertion oder and data being sorted always use HashSet
- if we need the insertion order we don't have much choice
- we have to use the LinkedHashSet, but if we don't care about the insertion order
we can compare it with TreeSet

LinkedHashSet                      vs       TreeHashSet
insertion is not slow                       Slowest insertion
Retrieval is super slow                     slower than HashSet but faster than the LinkSashSet
I don't care about insertion order   but    I don't care about retrival speed which headset to use?
Hashset

I care about insertion order but, I don't care about retrival speed which Set should I use?
LinkHashSet
if I want to have sorted data all the time?
Treeset
