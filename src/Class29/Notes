Set in java:

Set is an interface in collections frameworks which is implimented by many classes for example:
- Hashset,LinkedHashSet and ThreeHashSet

Properties of :
All the Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:
HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
- it is the fastes in all sets
-most widely used set
LinkedHashSet:
- maintains the insertion order
-slower that HashSet but faster that ThreSet specially in insertions
TreeSet:
- sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order
- it is slowest when it comes to store the data

When to use which type of Set:
- If we don't care abpout insertion oder and data being sorted always use HashSet
- if we need the insertion order we don't have much choice
- we have to use the LinkedHashSet
